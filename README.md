## Code
The `./code/` directory contains separate scripts to replicate each analytical figure of the article. The `./figures/` directory contains a copy of each of the figures generated by these scripts. 

  - [01-figure2-hitchhikers-versus-laws-by-congress-by-importantbill.R](https://github.com/CasAndreu/hitchhiker_bills/blob/master/code/01-figure2-hitchhikers-versus-laws-by-congress-by-importantbill.R): Code to replicate Figure 2 of the paper, showing the number of hitchhiker bills and laws By Congress, distinguishing between important and minor bills.

  - [03-models.R](https://github.com/CasAndreu/hitchhiker_bills/blob/master/code/03-models.R): Code to replicate Figure 4, and the model coefficients in Table 4 (in Supporting Information D), showing the relationship between a relevant set of covariates and the probability of a bill to be enacted as stand alone legislation or as a hitchhiker bill.

  - [04-figure5-general-effects-on-effectiveness.R](https://github.com/CasAndreu/hitchhiker_bills/blob/master/code/04-figure5-general-effect-on-effectiveness.R): Code to replicate figure 5 of the paper, showing how counting hitchhikers as enacted legislation increases the proportion of different types of members that get at least 1 bill enacted in any given Congress

Legislative Effectiveness Scores, of Volden and Weiseman. This script generates 2 figures: `figure6a-LES-vs-OUR-indiv-diff.png` and `figure6b-LES-vs-OUR-indiv-diff-FULL-DIST.png`. For the article we manually placed the second on into the upper right corner of the first. The first one is a truncated distribution whereas the second one illustrate the full distribution we aim to capture in this section of the article.
